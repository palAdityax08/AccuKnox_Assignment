# AccuKnox AI/ML Assessment - Aditya Pal

This repository contains my solutions for the Problem Statement 1 coding tasks.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `task1_books.py`: Fetches mock book data and stores it in SQLite.
- `task2_scores.py`: Visualizes student test scores using Matplotlib.
- `task3_csv_import.py`: Imports user data from CSV to SQLite.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib
2. Run any task:
   ```bash
   pyhton task1.py
   
📝 Assumptions Made
For Task 1 & 2, since no public API URL was provided, I mocked the API response data within the script as per instructions.
For Task 3, I created a dummy users.csv file for demonstration.
